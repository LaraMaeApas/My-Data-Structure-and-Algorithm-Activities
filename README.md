# CompanyHierarchy System 

## Introduction

This is a simple Java application that models a company hierarchy using a tree structure. The root node represents the CEO, and each employee can have multiple subordinates. The program allows users to add employees under a manager and display the entire company hierarchy.

## Featured

•	Add Employees: Users can add employees under specific managers.

•	Display Hierarchy: Users can view the whole company structure.

•	Tree Structure: The hierarchy is shown in a tree format, with managers and their subordinates.

•	Simple User Interface: The program is run through a console where users input data and interact with the app.

## Why this application was created

This application was created to demonstrate how tree structures work, especially for modeling hierarchical data like an organization chart. It helps users understand tree data structures and recursion in Java.

## How it contributes

For me  ( the Developer) : It improves skills in using tree structures and recursion in Java.

For Others: It provides a simple tool for managing employee hierarchies that can be used or expanded in real-life applications.
